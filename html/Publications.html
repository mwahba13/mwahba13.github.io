            <h5 style="color: black">A poetic eulogy for a great Albertan</h5>
            <p style="color: black"><i>Prairie Fire</i> was my submission for the YYC-POP poem anthology. YYC-POP was a call to the Calgary arts community
            to capture a literary portrait of a Calgarian who has left their mark on the city. I was inspired by a great Calgarian that I had the pleasure of meeting just the previous year.
               Someone who's grit is embodied through the pillars of education and academia he established in Alberta. <br><br> His accomplishments burn like a fire across the prairies, inspiring
                those who would follow in his wake.</p>
            <p style="color: black"><i>Prairie Fire</i> can be read <a href="../files/PrairieFire.pdf" style="text-decoration: underline"><b>here</b></a></p>
            <p style="color: black">The YYC-POP anthology was published in Fall 2020 and can be ordered <a href="https://www.frontenachouse.com/yyc-pop-poetic-portraits-of-people/" style="text-decoration: underline"><b>here</b></a></p>

            <h5 style="color: black"> A magical-realist exploration of how stories shape who we are</h5>
            <p style="color: black">ENGL 594 is a course which challenges students to complete a long work of fiction totalling around 100 pages. For my project,
                I chose to expand on <i>Zabaleen</i> a short story I wrote for a previous english class. Taking place in the "Garbage City" in Cairo, Egypt, <i>Zabaleen</i> tells
                the story of a young girl and her brother struggling to find their identity in country which has struggled to define itself. Zabaleen is the longest and
                most challenging piece (so far) that I have written. For my efforts in ENGL 594 I was awarded an A- from Professor Aritha Van Herk.</p>
            <p style="color: black">I intend to develop <i>Zabaleen</i> further and hope to publish it someday so I will only post a chapter <a href="../files/Zabaleen_Sample.pdf" style="text-decoration: underline"><b>here</b></a>.
                If you are interested in reading more, feel free to reach out and I can send over the whole manuscript.</p>

            <h5 style="color: black">A story of recursive horror</h5>
            <p style="color: black"><i>Infinite Regress</i> was my submission to WriterByte's "Boundless Night Science-Fiction Short-Story Contest" in Fall 2018. It was awarded third place, and for my efforts
            I earned my first (small) paycheque as a writer. When I wrote <i>Infinite Regress</i> I set out to write a story which would encompass some of the concepts that I had just begun to learn in my
            Computer Science degree. I knew I wanted to play with the idea of recursion (recursion(recursion)). Like many of the stories I write, I knew exactly how I wanted to start the piece, and how I wanted to end it.
            The hard part was writing everything in the middle.</p>

            <p style="color: black">I have had the idea for <i>The Wager</i> for a long time now. Inspired by William Gibson's seminal short-story <i>The Gernsback Continuum</i>,
             I wanted to exorcise the semiotic ghosts left flying around Las Vegas. What if someone from the ancient world saw how their sacred sites had been co-opted for
            entertainment? </p>

            <h5 style="color: black">A history of the genre from Snatcher to SHODAN</h5>
            <p style="color: black">The most expansive piece I have written for ScholarlyGamers.com, <i>A Survey of Cyberpunk Videogames</i> is an in-depth look into the history of the cyberpunk genre's effect on videogames.
            Using my knowledge of the cyberpunk literary tradition as a jumping off point (Shout out to Dr. Camara at the University of Calgary), I show the evolution of the genre in games from its rock 'n roll roots to more recent
            forays into post-cyberpunk.</p>

            when we placed 2nd overall in the undergraduate category, beating out teams from MIT and Harvard. Among our achievements, we also received the following awards:
